<h2>WHO</h2>
Ed Sheeran is a singer/songwriter who began playing guitar at a young age and soon after started writing his own songs.<br>

<br>Since signing with Atlantic, Sheeran has sold millions of records and won Grammys for hits like <br><strong><u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA"target=_blank title="Thinking Out Loud M/V">"Thinking Out Loud"</a></u> and <u>"Shape of You,"</u> as well as his 2018 album, รท.
